# Exercise 1 : What are you learning ?
# Instructions
# Write a function called display_message() that prints one sentence telling everyone what you are learning in this course.
# Call the function, and make sure the message displays correctly. -->


# def display_message():
#     print("I am learning python!")

# display_message()

# Exercise 2: What‚Äôs your favorite book ?
# Instructions
# Write a function called favorite_book() that accepts one parameter called title.
# The function should print a message, such as "One of my favorite books is <title>".
# For example: ‚ÄúOne of my favorite books is Alice in Wonderland‚Äù
# Call the function, make sure to include a book title as an argument when calling the function.

# def favorite_book(title):
#     print(f"One of my favorites books is {title}")

# favorite_book("Manuelita")

# Exercise 3 : Some Geography
# Instructions
# Write a function called describe_city() that accepts the name of a city and its country as parameters.
# The function should print a simple sentence, such as "<city> is in <country>".
# For example ‚ÄúReykjavik is in Iceland‚Äù
# Give the country parameter a default value.
# Call your function.

# def describe_city(city:str,country:str):
#     print(city, "is in", country)

# describe_city('Cordoba','Argentina')


# #Country as default
# def describe_city(city:str, country:str='Brazil'):
#     print(city, "is in", country)

# describe_city('Rio de Janeiro')


# Exercise 4 : Random
# Instructions
# Create a function that accepts a number between 1 and 100 and generates another number randomly between 1 and 100. Use the random module.
# Compare the two numbers, if it‚Äôs the same number, display a success message, otherwise show a fail message and display both numbers.

# import random


# def my_function():
#     user_number=int(input("Write a number between 1 and 100: "))
#     random_number=random.randint(1,100)
#     if user_number==random_number:
#         print("You succeed! the numbers are the same! Congratulations")
#     else:
#         print("Sorry, the numbers are not the same: ")
#         print("your number is:",user_number)
#         print("random number:",random_number)

# my_function()


#  Exercise 5 : Let‚Äôs create some personalized shirts !
# Instructions
# Write a function called make_shirt() that accepts a size and the text of a message that should be printed on the shirt.
# The function should print a sentence summarizing the size of the shirt and the message printed on it, such as "The size of the shirt is <size> and the text is <text>"
# Call the function make_shirt().

# Modify the make_shirt() function so that shirts are large by default with a message that reads ‚ÄúI love Python‚Äù by default.
# Call the function, in order to make a large shirt with the default message
# Make medium shirt with the default message
# Make a shirt of any size with a different message.

# Bonus: Call the function make_shirt() using keyword arguments.

# size=input("Write your tshirt size: S , M , L , XL and press enter ")
# message= input("Write the message you want to see in your tshirt and press enter ")
# def make_shirt():
#     print(f"The size of the shirt is {size} and the text is {message}")

# make_shirt()

#With defaults:

# size=input("Write your tshirt size: S , M , L , XL and press enter ")
# message= input("Write the message you want to see in your tshirt and press enter ")

# def make_shirt(size='Large', message='I love Python'):
#     print(f"The size of the shirt is {size} and the text is {message}")

# make_shirt(size='S',message='Hey there Im a data analyst!')




# Exercise 6 : Magicians ‚Ä¶
# Instructions
# Using the list of magician‚Äôs names

# Create a function called show_magicians(), which prints the name of each magician in the list.
# Write a function called make_great() that modifies the original list of magicians by adding the phrase "the Great" to each magician‚Äôs name.
# Call the function make_great().
# Call the function show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.


# magician_names = ['Harry Houdini', 'David Blaine', 'Criss Angel']

# def show_magicians():
#     for x in magician_names:
#         print(x)

# show_magicians()



# def make_great(magician_names):
#     for x in range(len(magician_names)):
#         magician_names[x]=magician_names[x]+" The great"
#         if x==len(magician_names)-1:
#             print(magician_names)

# make_great(magician_names)
# show_magicians()


# Exercise 7 : Temperature Advice

# import random
# def get_random_temp():
#     global temp
#     temp=random.randint(-10,40)
#     return temp
    

# print(get_random_temp())
# print(type(get_random_temp()))


# def main():
#     value=get_random_temp()
#     print(f"the temperature is now {value} degrees Celsius")

# main()



# Let‚Äôs add more functionality to the main() function. Write some friendly advice relating to the temperature:
# below zero (eg. ‚ÄúBrrr, that‚Äôs freezing! Wear some extra layers today‚Äù)
# between zero and 16 (eg. ‚ÄúQuite chilly! Don‚Äôt forget your coat‚Äù)
# between 16 and 23
# between 24 and 32
# between 32 and 40

# def main():
#     value=get_random_temp()
#     print(f"the temperature is now {value} degrees Celsius")
#     if value<0:
#         print('Brrr, that‚Äôs freezing! Wear some extra layers today')
#     elif value>=0 and value<16:
#         print('Quite chilly! Don‚Äôt forget your coat')
#     elif value>=16 and value<23:
#         print("you dont need a coat")
#     elif value >=23 and value<32:
#         print("you should put some sunscreen!üòä")
#     else:
#         print('very hot!')

# main()



# Change the get_random_temp() function:
# Add a parameter to the function, named ‚Äòseason‚Äô.
# Inside the function, instead of simply generating a random number between -10 and 40, set lower and upper limits based on the season, eg. if season is ‚Äòwinter‚Äô, temperatures should only fall between -10 and 16.

# import random
# def get_random_temp(season):
#     if season=='winter':
#         temp=round(random.uniform(-10,0),2)
#     elif season=='autumn' or season=='spring':
#         temp=round(random.uniform(0,20),2)
#     else:
#         temp=round(random.uniform(20,40),2)
#     return(temp)

# print(get_random_temp('summer'))
    

# Now that we‚Äôve changed get_random_temp(), let‚Äôs change the main() function:
# Before calling get_random_temp(), we will need to decide on a season, so that we can call the function correctly. Ask the user to type in a season - ‚Äòsummer‚Äô, ‚Äòautumn‚Äô (you can use ‚Äòfall‚Äô if you prefer), ‚Äòwinter‚Äô, or ‚Äòspring‚Äô.
# Use the season as an argument when calling get_random_temp().

# Bonus: Give the temperature as a floating-point number instead of an integer.

# season=input("Write the season:'summer','spring','autumn','winter' ")


# def main():
#     global season
#     value=get_random_temp(season)
#     print(f"the temperature is now {value} degrees Celsius")
#     if value<0:
#         return 'Brrr, that‚Äôs freezing! Wear some extra layers today'
#     elif value>=0 and value<16:
#         return 'Quite chilly! Don‚Äôt forget your coat'
#     elif value>=16 and value<23:
#         return "you dont need a coat"
#     elif value >=23 and value<32:
#         return "you should put some sunscreen!" 
#     else:
#         return 'very hot!'

# print(main())





# Bonus: Instead of asking for the season, ask the user for the number of the month (1 = January, 12 = December). Determine the season according to the month.

# a=[1,2,3]
# b=[4,5,6]
# c=[7,8,9]
# d=[10,11,12]


# month=int(input("Write the month in numbers (1 for January,etc) "))


# if month in a:
#     season="winter"

# if month in b:
#     season="spring"

# if month in c:
#     season="summer"

# if month in d:
#     season="autumn"


# import random
# def get_random_temp(season):
#     if season=='winter':
#         temp=random.uniform(-10,0)
#     elif season=='autumn' or season=='spring':
#         temp=random.uniform(0,20)
#     else:
#         temp=random.uniform(20,40)
#     return(temp)

# print(get_random_temp('summer'))
